                    Bugs and Things To Do after Release 0.3
                    ---------------------------------------

Outstanding  Bugs:
------------------

* There isn't any documentation!

* If you are in the middle of adding moderator comments to a message or have
  edited the headers and then select another message, you lose all your
  work on the message. One way to avoid that problem would be to create
  a new message view window when a list item is double-clicked. That way each
  message view window would maintain state information independently. However,
  client side locking would need to be changed since it assumes only one
  message is locked at any given time.

Wish List:
----------

* The code is a bloody mess! It really needs to be re-organized and it suffers
  from some bad design decisions. Someday it should be cleaned up.

* Would be nice if one could designate one's favorite editor or e-mail
  program to be launched when editing a user's submission or a followup
  or e-mail response.

* E-mail alert notifications indicating that there are messages waiting to be
  reviewed would be nice.

* Would be nice to search long messages using regular expressions.

* Column headers on the Review, Limbo, Archive, and Event lists would be
  very helpful!

* There needs to be some way for new moderators to test their setups; insertion
  of test messages when no POP account ready and posting to misc.test
  for test posts.

* Usenet cancel capability would be nice. However, since 3rd party cancels
  would be the ones most useful (e.g. forged approvals) and there may be
  problems with the way some servers honor cancels, and there being other
  software that can do this, it was not attempted. In the long run it might
  prove handy.

* Posting a follow-up from PyModerator would be nice. However, spell checking,
  quoting, grammar checking, word wrap at at column 72, providing user
  editing preferences, and the possible need for client-side generation of
  Message-ID headers combine to make this a problem not worth attempting.
  Best to have the moderator wait a bit for the article to show up at the
  moderator's Usenet server and use existing tools to reply as would anyone
  else.

* There really should be a common Admin e-mail reply-to address for e-mails
  sent to posters. That way replies could be attached to messages for all
  moderators to see. Not sure the best way to implement that though.
